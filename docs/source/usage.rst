Brief discussion of how to use the mods in the package package.

1. Reading/exploring the documentation
2. Trying the example codes (note you may need to install extra dependencies for
   some examples)
3. Working with a mod (a mod is self-contained, data-in data-out, just plug your
   data in)
4. Learning more (check out the mathematical model)
5. We welcome contributions!
