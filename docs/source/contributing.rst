Contributing a Mod
==================

Detailed instructions for contributing a new mod. A lot of this can come from
the existing CONTRIBUTING.md but needs review in light of everything we've
changed lately.

1. Development environment setup
2. Scaffolding for a new mod
3. Design requirements for a mod
4. Must come with unit tests and doc tests
5. Issues and PRs
6. Style/code quality requirements
