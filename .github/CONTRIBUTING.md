# Contributing Guide

To add a new Nup to the Stup:

1. Create an issue (use the 'New Nup Proposal' template to gather the required details), or, choose an existing issue to work on. Assign yourself to the issue.
2. Copy the required templates files for your new Nup. Name them appropriately.
3. Create a branch on your fork and commit the template files.
4. Create a draft PR for your branch into nupstup/main. The work does not have to be complete to create a PR.
5. Follow the PR checklist. When complete, take the PR out of draft and assign a reviewer.
